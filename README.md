# What is Gandalf?
In short, Gandalf is a access management system that allows guests to attend an event and pay directly up front. Attending users receive a code which they bring to event. At the event, this code gets scanned and printers provide the guest with a strap, giving them access to the event.

# Goals
* Provide a fully automated system for the description above
* Provide an admin panel where clubs, organisations, ... can add their events and add different groups of attendees (press, VIP, regulars, ...)

# Possible extensions
* Provide a section where different pieces of hardware (keys, walkies, ...) can be added and be provided with a code. Organisers can scan their own code and sequently scan the item, so it gets assigned to their name. If an item gets lost, you'll always have someone responsible!
